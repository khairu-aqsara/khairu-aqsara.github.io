# Personal Blog Constitution
<!-- Khairu Aqsara's Personal Documentation & Diary Blog -->

## Core Principles

### I. Readability First
Content MUST prioritize clarity and comprehension over complexity or technical jargon. Every article should be understandable by both the author in the future and potential readers with varying technical backgrounds. Use plain language, clear structure, and logical flow. Technical concepts should be explained in accessible terms with context provided.

### II. Personal Documentation Standard
All content serves as personal knowledge base and diary entries. Each post MUST include:
- Date and context when written
- Clear purpose or motivation for the topic
- Personal insights, lessons learned, or reflections
- Future reference value (how this helps future-self)
- Tags for easy categorization and retrieval

### III. Authenticity & Honesty (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Content MUST reflect genuine personal experiences, thoughts, and learnings. No artificial amplification or content created solely for SEO/engagement. Write for personal benefit first, public value second. Include both successes and failures, challenges and solutions. Maintain authentic voice throughout.

### IV. Consistent Structure & Organization
Every blog post MUST follow a consistent structure:
- Clear, descriptive title
- Brief summary/abstract
- Main content with proper headings
- Personal takeaways or conclusions
- Relevant tags and categories
- Cross-references to related posts when applicable

### V. Progressive Enhancement
Start with simple, text-based content that works without JavaScript or complex styling. Design should enhance readability without becoming a barrier. Mobile-first approach with clean typography. Fast loading times and accessible design patterns are mandatory.

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Standards
- Use active voice and conversational tone
- Break up long paragraphs (max 4-5 sentences)
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Add images, diagrams, or screenshots when they enhance understanding
- Provide context for technical decisions and trade-offs
- Include personal anecdotes and real-world applications

### Topics & Scope
- Technical learnings and discoveries
- Project retrospectives and lessons learned
- Career development and professional growth
- Tools, libraries, and workflow improvements
- Problem-solving approaches and debugging stories
- Industry observations and personal opinions
- Life experiences that provide learning value

## Architecture Principles

### VI. Fast Build Performance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Hugo-optimized build system MUST prioritize speed and efficiency:
- Sub-second rebuilds for single content changes
- Parallel processing of content and asset optimization
- Build times under 5 seconds for sites with <1000 posts
- Efficient template caching and content processing
- LiveReload support for development workflow
- Incremental builds that only process changed content
- Memory-efficient content processing pipeline

### VII. Efficient Markdown Support  
Markdown processing MUST leverage Hugo's built-in capabilities:
- Native Hugo Markdown renderer with Goldmark engine
- Built-in syntax highlighting with Chroma
- Shortcodes for reusable content components
- Front matter support (YAML, TOML, JSON)
- Content summaries and table of contents generation
- Image processing and optimization pipelines
- Cross-references and content relationships

### VIII. Consistent Visual Theme
Design system MUST ensure visual consistency using Hugo's theming:
- Hugo theme structure with layouts, partials, and assets
- Consistent typography scale and color system
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Theme customization through site parameters
- Sass/SCSS processing with Hugo Pipes
- Asset bundling and fingerprinting for cache optimization
- Dark/light mode support through CSS custom properties

### IX. Modular Archetypes (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Content creation MUST use Hugo archetypes for consistency:
- Standardized post archetype with required frontmatter
- Category-specific archetypes for different content types
- Automated metadata population (date, slug, draft status)
- Content template scaffolding for consistent structure
- Validation rules embedded in archetype templates
- Custom archetypes for special content types (projects, reviews, etc.)

### X. Robust Testing Framework
Comprehensive testing MUST cover all Hugo content rendering:
- Automated testing of Hugo build process and output
- Content validation for frontmatter and markdown syntax
- Link checking for internal and external references
- Image optimization and reference validation  
- Template rendering tests for all content types
- Performance regression testing for build times
- Accessibility testing integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Requirements

### Hugo Best Practices Standards
- Hugo project structure following official conventions
- Content organization in /content directory with logical sections
- Static assets in /static with optimization through Hugo Pipes
- Layouts following Hugo's lookup order and template hierarchy
- Partials for reusable template components
- Data files in /data for structured content and configuration
- Multi-language support preparation even for single-language sites

### Performance Standards
- Build time under 5 seconds for typical content volume (Hugo optimized)
- Page load time under 2 seconds on 3G connections
- Core Web Vitals scores consistently in "Good" range
- Lighthouse Performance score >95
- Efficient image delivery with Hugo's image processing
- Asset bundling and minification through Hugo Pipes
- CDN-friendly static asset generation

### Accessibility & SEO Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all generated pages
- Semantic HTML5 structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Meta tags and Open Graph data generation
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for rich search results
- XML sitemap and robots.txt generation
- RSS/Atom feeds for content syndication
- Image alt text validation and optimization
- Color contrast ratio validation (minimum 4.5:1)

### Content Moderation & Privacy
Following Hugo privacy and content guidelines:
- Privacy-friendly analytics integration (if any)
- GDPR compliance for EU visitors
- Content moderation through Hugo's content management
- No tracking cookies without explicit consent
- Local asset hosting to avoid third-party dependencies
- Secure content delivery with proper headers
- Data minimization in content processing and storage

## Governance

### Content Review Process
- All posts undergo self-review after 24-hour cooling period
- Check for typos, clarity, and logical flow before publishing
- Verify all code examples work as described
- Ensure personal insights are clearly articulated
- Validate that content serves future reference purpose

### Quality Gates
- Every post must answer: "Will this help me 6 months from now?"
- Technical accuracy verified through testing/research
- Personal value clearly articulated
- Writing clarity confirmed through self-reading aloud
- Mobile readability verified on actual device
- All tests pass before deployment (Hugo build, accessibility, performance)
- Build performance meets defined benchmarks (<5 seconds)
- Accessibility compliance verified with automated tools (axe, WAVE)
- SEO optimization validated (meta tags, structured data, sitemap)

### Development Workflow
- Hugo-based development with live reload and fast iteration
- Content creation using standardized Hugo archetypes
- Automated testing integrated with Hugo build pipeline
- Performance regression testing on builds
- Documentation updates with theme and content changes
- Modular development following Hugo's component patterns
- Version control for content, themes, and configuration

### Hugo-Specific Quality Assurance
- Hugo version compatibility and upgrade path planning
- Theme maintenance and customization best practices
- Content archetype validation and consistency checks
- Hugo shortcode testing and documentation
- Template performance optimization and caching
- Asset pipeline efficiency and optimization verification

### Amendment Policy
This constitution supersedes all other content guidelines and development practices. Changes require explicit documentation of rationale and impact assessment. Constitution amendments should be rare and well-justified. When in doubt, favor Hugo best practices and simplicity over custom solutions. All architecture decisions must align with the ten core principles and Hugo's philosophy of speed and simplicity.
