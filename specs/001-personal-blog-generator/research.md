# Research: Hugo Personal Blog Implementation

## Hugo Version & Features Research

**Decision**: Hugo Extended >= 0.115
**Rationale**: 
- Version 0.115+ includes latest performance improvements and security patches
- Extended version required for Hugo Pipes SCSS/Sass processing
- Stable release with mature feature set for personal blogging
- GitHub Actions has official Hugo setup action supporting latest versions

**Alternatives considered**:
- Hugo Standard version: Lacks SCSS processing capabilities needed for theme customization
- Older versions (0.100-0.114): Missing performance optimizations and security updates
- Other SSGs (Jekyll, Gatsby, Next.js): More complex setup, slower build times, or dynamic dependencies

## PaperMod Theme Research

**Decision**: PaperMod community theme via git submodule
**Rationale**:
- Actively maintained with 4k+ stars and regular updates
- Fast, lightweight theme optimized for Hugo's performance
- Built-in dark/light mode support and responsive design
- Excellent documentation and customization options
- Strong SEO features and accessibility compliance
- Clean, readable design perfect for personal blogging

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom theme development: Time-intensive, reinventing well-solved problems  
- Ananke theme: Less feature-rich, limited customization options
- Academic theme: Too complex for personal blog use case
- Minimal themes: Lack advanced features like search, taxonomies, SEO

## Configuration Format Research

**Decision**: hugo.toml (TOML format)
**Rationale**:
- Hugo's preferred configuration format as of v0.110+
- More readable and maintainable than YAML for configuration
- Better error messages and validation
- Consistent with Hugo community best practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- config.yaml: Older format, more error-prone with indentation
- config.json: Less readable, not commonly used in Hugo community
- Multiple config files: Unnecessary complexity for single-author blog

## Frontmatter Format Research

**Decision**: Support both YAML and TOML frontmatter
**Rationale**:
- Hugo natively supports both formats without configuration
- YAML more familiar to most developers
- TOML more consistent with Hugo's config format
- Flexibility allows migration between formats if needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON frontmatter: Less readable, not commonly used for content
- Single format enforcement: Reduces flexibility without significant benefit

## Asset Processing Research

**Decision**: Hugo Pipes for CSS/JS processing, /static/ for images
**Rationale**:
- Hugo Pipes provides built-in minification, bundling, and fingerprinting
- SCSS/Sass compilation without external tools
- Automatic cache busting via asset fingerprinting
- /static/ directory serves images directly without processing overhead
- Simpler deployment pipeline with no external build tools

**Alternatives considered**:
- External build tools (webpack, rollup): Adds complexity, slower builds
- No asset processing: Missing optimization opportunities  
- Image processing via Hugo: Unnecessary for simple personal blog images
- CDN for all assets: Adds external dependencies, violates static-only principle

## Deployment Strategy Research

**Decision**: GitHub Actions with official Hugo action deploying to gh-pages branch
**Rationale**:
- Official GitHub Actions Hugo setup action is well-maintained
- Automatic deployment on push to main branch
- Built-in GitHub Pages integration
- No external CI/CD dependencies
- Supports custom domains and SSL automatically

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual deployment: Error-prone, no automation
- Netlify/Vercel: External dependencies, more complex setup
- GitHub Actions with manual Hugo install: More complex, less reliable
- Direct push to gh-pages: No build automation, version control issues

## Taxonomy Configuration Research

**Decision**: Enable tags and categories taxonomies with custom permalinks
**Rationale**:
- Hugo's built-in taxonomy system requires no plugins
- Automatic generation of taxonomy pages and listings  
- SEO-friendly URLs with /posts/:slug/ permalink structure
- Good for content organization and discovery

**Alternatives considered**:
- No taxonomies: Limits content organization and discoverability
- Custom taxonomy implementation: Reinventing Hugo's built-in features
- Date-based permalinks only: Less SEO-friendly, harder to remember URLs

## Search Implementation Research

**Decision**: Client-side search with Hugo-generated JSON index
**Rationale**:
- Works with static hosting (no server-side search needed)
- Hugo can generate JSON output format for content
- Fast search experience with pre-built index
- No external search service dependencies

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-side search: Requires dynamic hosting, violates static-only principle
- External search services (Algolia): Adds external dependencies and costs
- No search functionality: Reduces content discoverability
- Full-text search via git: Too slow, not user-friendly

## Development Workflow Research

**Decision**: hugo server for development, hugo --minify for production builds
**Rationale**:
- Built-in Hugo development server with live reload
- Fast incremental builds during development
- Production builds with automatic minification
- Simple single-command workflow for both environments

**Alternatives considered**:
- External development server: Adds complexity, loses Hugo integration
- Manual file watching: More error-prone, loses automation
- Complex build scripts: Unnecessary complexity for Hugo's built-in features
