# Implementation Plan: Hugo Personal Blog

**Branch**: `001-personal-blog-generator` | **Date**: 2025-01-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-personal-blog-generator/spec.md`

## Summary
Create a Hugo-powered personal blog with PaperMod theme, featuring Markdown posts with YAML/TOML frontmatter, taxonomies for tags/categories, custom homepage layout, standardized archetypes, Hugo Pipes asset processing, and GitHub Actions deployment to GitHub Pages. The system prioritizes fast builds, clean content organization, and static-only architecture.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Hugo >= 0.115 (Static Site Generator)
**Primary Dependencies**: Hugo Extended, PaperMod community theme, Hugo Pipes for asset processing
**Storage**: Git-based content management, static files in `/static/`, processed assets via Hugo Pipes
**Testing**: Hugo build validation, HTML link checking, asset pipeline verification
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages static hosting, compatible with modern web browsers
**Project Type**: Static site generator with Hugo-specific structure
**Performance Goals**: <5 second builds, <2 second page loads, Core Web Vitals "Good" scores
**Constraints**: Static-only hosting, no server-side processing, GitHub Pages compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: Personal blog with 100-1000 posts, single author, English language only

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✅ Fast Build Performance**: Hugo >=0.115 with incremental builds and Hugo Pipes optimization
**✅ Efficient Markdown Support**: Native Hugo Goldmark renderer with Chroma syntax highlighting
**✅ Consistent Visual Theme**: PaperMod theme with customization via site parameters and partials
**✅ Modular Archetypes**: Standardized post creation with YAML/TOML frontmatter templates
**✅ Robust Testing Framework**: Build validation, link checking, and asset pipeline testing
**✅ Accessibility & SEO**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, semantic HTML, meta tags, structured data
**✅ Privacy Compliance**: Static-only approach, no tracking cookies, local asset hosting
**✅ Hugo Best Practices**: Official project structure, content organization, template hierarchy

No constitutional violations detected. Hugo-based approach aligns with all performance, maintainability, and accessibility principles.

```

**Structure Decision**: Hugo static site generator with standard Hugo directory conventions. Uses community PaperMod theme as git submodule, with custom layouts for homepage override. Content managed in `/content/` with posts and pages separation. Static assets in `/static/` for direct serving, processed assets in `/assets/` for Hugo Pipes optimization.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research ✅

**Research Complete**: All technology decisions documented in research.md
- Hugo Extended >= 0.115 for SSG with SCSS support
- PaperMod theme for performance and features
- TOML configuration format for maintainability
- Hugo Pipes for asset processing
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Client-side search with JSON index

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented and justified

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅

**Design Complete**: All entities and contracts defined
1. **Data Model**: Documented in data-model.md with post structure, frontmatter schema, site configuration
2. **Configuration Contract**: hugo.toml template with all required settings
3. **Content Templates**: Post archetype with standardized frontmatter structure  
4. **Deployment Contract**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
5. **Agent Context**: Updated .github/copilot-instructions.md with Hugo-specific guidance

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/* (config, archetype, workflow), quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
- Generate Hugo-specific setup and configuration tasks
- Create content structure and archetype implementation tasks  
- Add theme installation and customization tasks
- Include asset processing and optimization tasks
- Generate deployment and validation tasks

**Task Categories**:
1. **Environment Setup** [P]: Hugo installation, theme setup, directory structure
2. **Configuration** [P]: Site config, menu setup, taxonomy configuration
3. **Content Structure**: Archetypes, initial content, about page
4. **Theme Customization**: Layout overrides, asset processing, responsive design
5. **Search Implementation**: JSON index generation, client-side search UI
6. **Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub Actions, Pages configuration, domain setup
7. **Validation & Testing**: Build verification, link checking, performance testing

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup tasks first (Hugo, theme, directories)
- Configuration tasks parallel to content structure [P]
- Theme and content tasks building on configuration
- Search and advanced features after basic site working
- Deployment after local development complete
- Testing and validation throughout and at end

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks focusing on Hugo best practices and fast iteration

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

*Based on Constitution v3.0.0 - See `/memory/constitution.md`*

## Ready for /tasks Command

This plan is complete and ready for task generation. The /tasks command should:
1. Load the task template from `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`
2. Generate Hugo-specific implementation tasks based on the contracts and data model
3. Create ordered, executable tasks following TDD and Hugo best practices
4. Include proper validation and testing steps throughout

**Next Command**: `/tasks` to generate the implementation task list.
