# Feature Specification: Hugo Personal Blog

**Feature Branch**: `001-personal-blog-generator`  
**Created**: 2025-01-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a personal blog using Hugo where posts are written in Markdown and organized by date and tag. The site should feature a customizable homepage, individual post pages, tags, archives, about page, auto-generated RSS, and built-in search. Support easy theme switching, fast local preview, and publish-ready output."

**Clarifications**: Posts use YAML or TOML frontmatter for metadata. Pagination enabled on homepage and archives (10 posts per page). Static assets only - no dynamic comments in v1. Multilingual support not needed initially. Deploy to GitHub Pages. Images stored under `static/` directory. CSS and JavaScript handled via Hugo Pipes for minification and optimization.

## Overview

A Hugo-powered personal blog optimized for fast development, content creation, and publishing workflow. The system leverages Hugo's built-in capabilities and Pipes for asset processing to transform Markdown posts into a complete static website with advanced content organization, theming flexibility, and lightning-fast build times. Built with Hugo best practices for personal documentation and professional sharing, specifically targeting GitHub Pages deployment.

**Target User**: Personal blogger and content creator (Khairu Aqsara)  
**Primary Use Case**: Personal documentation, technical writing, project showcases, and knowledge sharing  
**Technology**: Hugo static site generator with Hugo Pipes asset processing and custom theme  
**Deployment Target**: GitHub Pages with automated Hugo build pipeline  
**Asset Strategy**: Static-only approach with images in `/static/` and optimized CSS/JS via Hugo Pipes  
**Core Value**: Professional-grade personal blog with Hugo's speed, flexibility, and modern web standards without dynamic dependencies

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a personal blogger and content creator, I want to use Hugo to write posts in Markdown with YAML or TOML frontmatter and have them automatically built into a beautiful, fast website with paginated listings, optimized assets via Hugo Pipes, and seamless GitHub Pages deployment that makes sharing my knowledge effortless without any dynamic dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have Hugo installed and a new blog project initialized, **When** I create a new post using `hugo new posts/my-post.md`, **Then** a properly structured Markdown file with YAML or TOML frontmatter is created using the post archetype.

2. **Given** I have written multiple posts over time, **When** I visit the homepage or archive pages, **Then** I see 10 posts per page with pagination controls for navigating through all content chronologically.

3. **Given** I include images in my posts, **When** I store them in the `/static/` directory and reference them in Markdown, **Then** they are properly served and accessible in the generated site without processing.

4. **Given** I have CSS and JavaScript assets, **When** Hugo builds the site, **Then** these assets are processed through Hugo Pipes for minification, bundling, and optimization automatically.

5. **Given** I want to deploy my blog, **When** I push to the main branch, **Then** GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the Hugo site without requiring dynamic server capabilities.

6. **Given** I want a clean, focused blogging experience, **When** I use the blog, **Then** there are no comment systems or dynamic features that could complicate hosting or maintenance in version 1.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I mix YAML and TOML frontmatter across different posts?
- How does pagination work when I have exactly 10, 11, or 0 published posts?
- What occurs when I reference images in `/static/` that don't exist or have incorrect paths?
- How does Hugo Pipes handle CSS/JS assets that have syntax errors or import issues?
- What happens if GitHub Pages build fails due to Hugo version incompatibility?
- How does the site handle missing or malformed frontmatter in content files?
