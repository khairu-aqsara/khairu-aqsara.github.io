# Docker Containers: A Complete Guide

{{< responsive-image src="images/test-article-banner.webp" alt="Docker containers illustration" class="featured-image" >}}

Docker revolutionized software deployment by providing lightweight, portable containers. Let's dive into containerization concepts.

## What are Containers?

Containers package applications with their dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

## Basic Docker Commands

Essential commands for container management:

```bash
# Build an image
docker build -t myapp .

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id
```

## Dockerfile Best Practices

1. Use specific base images
2. Minimize layers
3. Use multi-stage builds
4. Don't run as root user

## Docker Compose

For multi-container applications:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  database:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
```

Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across development and production environments.
