# JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers modern web development. In this post, we'll explore the core concepts every developer should know.

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript supports several data types:
- Numbers
- Strings  
- Booleans
- Arrays
- Objects

## Functions

Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const arrowFunction = (x, y) => x + y;
```

## Async Programming

Modern JavaScript heavily uses promises and async/await:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}
```

JavaScript continues to evolve with new features being added regularly!
